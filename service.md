# Managing OpenStack services

## The openstack-service command

These instructions make use of the `openstack-service` command,
available from the `openstack-utils` package.  After configuring the
appropriate repositories, you can upgrade to the latest version by
running:

    # yum install openstack-utils

## <a name="stop">Stopping services</a>

To stop all the OpenStack services running on a host:

    # openstack-service stop

To stop a specific suite of services (e.g., all Nova services)
running on a host:

    # openstack-service stop nova

Which on a Nova controller might result in:

    Stopping openstack-nova-api: [  OK  ]
    Stopping openstack-nova-cert: [  OK  ]
    Stopping openstack-nova-conductor: [  OK  ]
    Stopping openstack-nova-consoleauth: [  OK  ]
    Stopping openstack-nova-scheduler: [  OK  ]

    # openstack-service start
