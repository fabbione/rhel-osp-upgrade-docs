# Scenario 3: One service at a time with parallel Compute

For most services this scenario is identical to scenario 2, with the
exception of the compute service.  Rather than upgrading your existing
compute nodes as part of this process, you deploy new compute nodes
running the Havana compute service.  You wait for existing workloads
on your Grizzly compute nodes to complete (or migrate them by hand),
and when a Grizzly compute node is no longer hosting any instances you
upgrade the computer service on that node.

1. Follow the procedure for [scenario 2][s2], but stop after completing
   the Quantum to Neutron upgrade (do not upgrade either Nova or
   Horizon).

   You will want to run the final `yum upgrade` on systems that are
   not running Nova services.

## Deploy the new compute environment

1. Set up a parallel compute environment: install a new Nova controller, Horizon server, and compute nodes using the Havana repositories.

     These systems will use a configuration generally identical to that
     on your Grizzly Nova nodes.  They will be making use of the
     same Keystone, Glance, Cinder, etc. services.

     Your Havana compute environment *must* use a database
     distinct from that used by your Grizzly environment.

1. Ensure that you new environment can see identity information,
   images, volumes and other items in your existing environment.

1. Ensure that your community is able to access the new dashboard and
   API services.

## Move instances to the new environment

1. Migrate instances to the Havana compute nodes

     The simplest method for "migrating" an instance is to simply
     stop the instance running in your Grizzly environment and deploy
     a new one on the Havana infrastructure.

     If re-deployment is not an option, you can move instances from
     your Grizzly compute nodes to your Havana compute nodes with
     minimal downtime via the following process:
     
     1. Snapshot the existing instance.
     1. Delete the existing instance.
     1. Boot a new instance on the Havana compute nodes from the
        snapshot.
     1. Allocate and assign any necessary floating addresses

          In a Neutron environment, you should be able to re-assign
          your previously allocated addresses as soon as the instance
          to which they were assigned is shut down.

          In a Nova networking environment, you will need to create
          new floating ip pools identical to those in your Grizzly
          environment and then explicitly allocate the necessary
          floating ip addresses before assigning them.

          The `nova floating-ip-bulk-create` command can be used to
          allocate explicit addresses.

1. When you are able to move all the instances from one of your
   existing Grizzly compute nodes, you can redeploy that node in your
   Havana compute environment.

1. When you have moved all your compute nodes into the Havana
   environment, you can retire any remaining Grizzly Nova services.
